# Table — Implementation status

_Last updated 2026-10-08 (UTC). Owner: Jon. Implementation: Claude._

## Stage reached

**Stages 1–4 implemented against a clearly labeled simulated retailer.** Stage 5 (Kroger) is
documentation-only and live integration is **BLOCKED** (no credentials, no authorization).
Stage 6 (household release/deployment) not started. Nothing was pushed, deployed, or sent to a
real store.

| Stage | State |
|---|---|
| 1 Executable contract & fixtures | Done — pinned stack, migrations, Better Auth, deterministic fixture, recording fake retailer, two-user harness |
| 2 Persistent shared plan & concurrency | Done — first slice evidence `evidence/2026-10-08-first-slice-e2e.md` |
| 3 Quantities & honest grocery state | Done (including pickup-time constraint on expected supply) |
| 4 Household experience | Done for the mock workflow; device/Safari validation not available (B8) |
| 5 Verified Kroger integration | BLOCKED — capability documented in INTEGRATION-CAPABILITIES.md; adapter fails closed |
| 6 Household release | Not started (needs hosting decision; no paid provisioning authorized) |

## Code identity

- Workspace: `/home/user/table` (local Git, branch `main`, **no remote**). See final commit in
  `git log -1`; the evidence file of each run records the exact commit.
- This cloud container is ephemeral: until B1 (a repository destination Jon names) is done,
  the code exists only here.

## What works (mock workflow, two members)

- Sign-in per member (no public sign-up); every read/write scoped to the member's household.
- Week: one complete proposal (effort/variety/novelty/sessions controls, Fewer sessions,
  Different dinners, factual reasons, named unresolved nights), deliberate **Use this week**;
  after adoption: next dinner (household timezone), status sentence, Cook / Reheat views,
  per-night Change → Replace / Move / Backup / Night out / Open previews with consequences,
  grocery delta and additional basket cost; Apply / Cancel; locks; deferred dinners; per-member
  component plates with nutrition vs that member's dinner target; reserved lunches; "less left
  than planned" facts.
- Live shared state: SSE + refetch on focus/visible/online + 15 s poll; stale drafts flagged
  before Apply, Apply/Adopt/Send disabled until the view is current.
- Groceries: consolidated lines with reasons (meals, usual requests with contributors, extras),
  Have enough / Have some (+amount) / Need, product choice and manual products/prices
  (simulated store), per-line approvals, readiness, three cost views with unknowns, simulated
  Send with frozen batches, uncertain-transfer resolution, order confirmation (explicit contents
  or "contents unknown"), receipts (received / missing / substituted), "Not sent yet" deltas.
- Our Recipes / Explore: search (focus-stable), filters, sorts by real values with an
  "unknown" group, Sounds good, per-member preferences, favorites, notes, explicit cooking
  history, structured manual recipe entry/edit creating immutable versions.
- Household: saved inputs (all start unset), separate daily/dinner targets per member,
  exclusions, ingredient review, connection status, JSON export.

## Run it locally

```bash
npm ci
scripts/db.sh start
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://table@127.0.0.1:54329/table_dev
npm run db:migrate
npm run household:create -- "Our table" America/New_York          # prints the household id
TABLE_NEW_PASSWORD='choose-10+-chars' npm run member:create -- <householdId> jon@example.com "Jon"
TABLE_NEW_PASSWORD='choose-10+-chars' npm run member:create -- <householdId> alex@example.com "Alex"
npm run sample:recipes -- <householdId>     # optional: 8 labeled sample recipes, no prices/nutrition
npx next build && TABLE_ENV=development BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 npx next start -p 3000
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in two different browsers/profiles and sign in as each member.
Backup/restore: `scripts/backup.sh dump|restore|check` (dumps include auth tables — store securely).

## Evidence

See ACCEPTANCE.md for per-test status and `docs/table/evidence/` for raw run records.

## Blockers (genuine)

1. Repository destination for this code (B1) — owner decision.
2. Kroger: developer app credentials, store location, account authorization, and written
   approval for one live cart addition (B5/B6).
3. Real devices / Safari for X11 device validation (B8).
4. Hosting decision for Stage 6 (B9). No paid service will be provisioned without approval.

## Next executable task

**B3 — replacement suggestions prefer received goods, and additional basket cost counts only
packages beyond what is already ordered/received** (no owner input needed; scope and done-criteria
in BACKLOG.md). Owner-gated items: B1 repository destination, B5/B6 Kroger, B8 devices, B9 hosting.
